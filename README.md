Behavioral risk factor analysis 

#Project Description
Behavioral risk factor analysis based on preventive health practices and risk behaviors in the adult population

#Abstract
Behavioral risk factor analysis helps us to understand standardized, state-specific data on preventative health measures and risk behaviors connected to chronic illnesses, accidents, and preventable infectious infections in the adult population. Factors assessed include general health, physical health, mental health, exercise, asthma, heart disease, smoking, alcohol intake, tobacco use, health care coverage, HIV AIDS, physical activity, and fruit and vegetable consumption and similarly.

This analysis will be highly useful to understand the preventive health practices and risk behaviors that are linked to chronic diseases, injuries, and preventable infectious diseases in the adult population. This analysis will provide a wide range of opportunities to explore different factors that affect our health on a day-to-day basis. Also, we will be able to uncover various factors like use of tobacco, health care coverage, HIV/AIDS knowledge, or prevention among adults. This study will focus on getting insights on the physical activity and balanced diet of an adult like fruit and vegetable consumption that contribute to overall sound health. Hence, at the end of this analysis, we will be able to understand the risks associated with the behavior of an adult.

Here, we have collected the dataset from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. After data preprocessing, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the risk associated with each behavior on the overall health of an adult. Statistical testing like Correlation test was done to understand the correlation of general health on various factors. Finally, we implemented Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Classifier to predict the general health of an adult in the future and K-Means Clustering to divide the data into clusters as per the risks associated. At the end, we can say that this dissertation has helped us to deeply understand the risks associated with the adultâ€™s behavior hence it is essential to prevent the risks associated with adult health.
